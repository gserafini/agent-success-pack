# Agent Success Pack 🤖

**Enterprise-grade project scaffolding framework designed for AI-assisted development**

Stop starting from scratch. Stop losing context. Stop forgetting to document decisions.

Agent Success Pack provides battle-tested templates, scripts, and patterns to establish clear scope, requirements, implementation plans, and quality standards from day one—optimized for working with AI coding assistants like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot.

---

## Quick Start

###  Recommended: Layer on Claude Code Init

**Best Practice**: Run this AFTER Claude Code's `/init` command to layer project management on top of the baseline setup.

```bash
# 1. First, let Claude Code initialize your project
# In Claude Code chat:
/init

# 2. Then add Agent Success Pack for structured project management
git submodule add https://github.com/gserafini/agent-success-pack.git .agent-success-pack

# 3. Run interactive setup
cd .agent-success-pack
./scripts/init.sh

# 4. Follow prompts - select "Enhance" for existing files to preserve Claude's setup
```

### Add to Existing Project

```bash
# Add as git submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/gserafini/agent-success-pack.git .agent-success-pack

# Run interactive setup
cd .agent-success-pack
./scripts/init.sh

# Follow the prompts to customize for your project
```

## Why This Exists

### The Problem

Every new project requires the same foundational work:
- ✅ Define scope and requirements
- ✅ Track architecture decisions
- ✅ Plan implementation phases
- ✅ Document for AI assistants
- ✅ Set up quality infrastructure
- ✅ Track progress and blockers

Teams either:
1. 🔁 Start from scratch each time (inefficient, inconsistent)
2. 📋 Copy-paste from old projects (outdated, project-specific)
3. 🤷 Skip documentation (technical debt, unclear scope)

### The Solution

**Agent Success Pack** provides:
- ✅ **Consistency** - Same structure across all projects
- ✅ **Speed** - 50%+ reduction in setup time
- ✅ **Quality** - Enforced standards from day one
- ✅ **AI-Optimized** - Clear context for AI assistants
- ✅ **Flexibility** - Customizable templates
- ✅ **Best Practices** - Proven patterns built-in

## Key Features

### 🎯 Phase-Based Implementation

Break projects into manageable phases with clear deliverables:

- **Phase 0**: Foundation & Quality Infrastructure
- **Phase 1-N**: Feature implementation phases
- Each phase has acceptance criteria and review points
- Track progress with visual indicators

### 📝 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Document **why** decisions were made, not just **what**:

- Context: What prompted this decision?
- Options: What alternatives were considered?
- Decision: What was chosen?
- Rationale: Why this option?
- Consequences: What are the tradeoffs?

### 🤖 AI Assistant Optimization

Templates designed for maximum AI effectiveness:

- **Clear Context**: AI always knows project scope and current state
- **Established Patterns**: Consistent code patterns to follow
- **Quality Standards**: Built-in testing and linting expectations
- **Decision History**: Historical context via ADRs
- **Progress Tracking**: Always know what to work on next

### 📊 Progress & Session Management

Never lose context between sessions:

- Session notes with token usage tracking
- Visual progress indicators
- Blocker tracking
- Metrics dashboard
- Weekly goal setting

### ✅ Quality Infrastructure

Battle-tested configurations included:

- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright setup
- **Linting**: ESLint 9.x (flat config)
- **Formatting**: Prettier + Tailwind plugin
- **Git Hooks**: Husky + lint-staged
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode + ts-reset
- **Environment**: T3 Env validation
