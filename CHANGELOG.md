## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Early Exit Option** - Safe bailout before making any changes
  - Detects existing Agent Success Pack files at startup
  - Shows which files already exist
  - Prompts "Do you want to continue? (y/N)" - defaults to No
  - Exit cleanly without changes if user chooses No

- **Smart Project Name Suggestion** - Auto-detects project name from existing files
  - Tries sources in order: CLAUDE.md ‚Üí README.md ‚Üí package.json ‚Üí directory name
  - Displays as editable suggestion: `Project Name [suggested: Reentry Map]:`
  - Press Enter to accept, or type to override
  - Converts kebab-case and snake_case to Title Case
  - Makes re-initialization much smoother

### Changed

- **Generic Phase 0 Template** - No longer assumes Node.js/TypeScript stack
  - Removed hardcoded references to ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright
  - Now focuses on universal best practices: version control, documentation, quality standards
  - Sections marked as "Optional - adapt to your stack"
  - Provides examples for multiple languages (ESLint/pylint/shellcheck, Prettier/Black/shfmt)
  - Works for bash scripts, Python, Node.js, or any project type
  - Encourages users to skip sections that don't apply

- **Simplified Re-run Flow** - Removed upfront "already initialized" detection
  - Natural file-by-file decision making during normal flow
  - Reuses existing 4-option file handling (keep/enhance/backup/replace)
  - Cleaner UX - make decisions in context as you encounter each file
  - No confusing "modes" or backup directories

- **Bootstrap Auto-Update** - Automatically updates existing installations
  - Checks for updates when .agent-success-pack already exists
  - Compares local and remote commits
  - Auto-pulls latest version before running init
  - Shows "Already up to date" or "Updated to latest version"
  - Ensures users always get the latest features and fixes

### Fixed

- **Project Name Detection Validation** - More robust extraction and fallback
  - Trims whitespace from all extracted names
  - Validates suggestions must be > 2 characters
  - Fixed package.json parsing for BSD sed (macOS compatibility)
  - Always falls back to directory name if detection fails
  - Prevents blank or invalid suggestions like "or"

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-23

### üéâ Major Enhancement: Intelligent Merge Mode

The init script now intelligently analyzes existing files and offers to enhance them rather than just skip or overwrite!

### Added

- **File Purpose Explanations** - Every file shows its purpose when detected
  - Helps new users understand what they're working with
  - Examples: "PROGRESS.md: Tracks your project progress, session notes, metrics, and blockers"

- **Existing File Analysis** - Automatically reads and summarizes files before prompting
  - Shows size, line count, first line preview
  - Extracts key metrics specific to file type:
    - PROGRESS.md: Current phase, overall progress
    - CLAUDE.md: Project name
    - IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md: Phase count, task completion stats
    - ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md: Number of ADRs documented

- **Intelligent Merge Mode** (Option 2) - NEW!
  - Analyzes existing file structure
  - Adds missing Agent Success Pack sections
  - Preserves ALL custom content
  - Smart enhancements:
    - CLAUDE.md: Adds framework reference if missing
    - PROGRESS.md: Adds session tracking section if missing
    - IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md: Adds Phase 0 template if missing
    - ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md: Adds ADR format explanation if missing

- **Enhanced Options** - Now 4 options instead of 3:
  1. Keep existing (default, safest - no changes)
  2. Enhance existing (NEW - intelligent merge)
  3. Backup and replace (saves .bak file)
  4. Replace without backup (explicit danger warning)

- **Better UX**:
  - Beautiful formatted output with unicode borders
  - Color-coded options (green=safe, blue=enhance, yellow=backup, red=danger)
  - Clear default shown: `[default: 1]`
  - Descriptive action messages

### Changed

- File prompts now show comprehensive information before asking for action
- Default remains option 1 (keep existing) for maximum safety
- Enhanced visual output with better formatting
- **Bootstrap Script ASCII Art** - Redesigned with cleaner layout
  - "AGENT" in large 6-line block letters (green)
  - "SUCCESS PACK" on single line with decorative brackets (yellow)
  - 56-character box width for full AGENT text
  - Perfect border alignment

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: BSD sed compatibility** - Enhance mode now works on macOS
  - Fixed `sed` range address error ("command a expects up to 1 address")
  - Rewrote CLAUDE.md and ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md enhancements for BSD sed
  - Uses single address with label loop instead of range addresses
- **ASCII Art Alignment** - Perfect border alignment across all lines
  - Consistent spacing on left and right borders
  - All content properly centered within box

### Use Cases

1. **Existing Projects**: Run init.sh and select "Enhance" to add framework benefits without losing custom content
2. **Framework Upgrades**: Update submodule and enhance files to get new features
3. **Team Onboarding**: File purpose explanations help new team members understand structure
4. **Incremental Adoption**: No longer "all or nothing" - add structure gradually

### Breaking Changes

None - all enhancements are backward compatible.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-23

### üõ°Ô∏è Critical Safety Fix

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: init.sh now checks if files exist before overwriting
- Added `create_file_safe()` function with 3 options:
  1. Skip (keep existing)
  2. Backup and overwrite
  3. Overwrite without backup
- Previous behavior would blindly overwrite PROGRESS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.
- Now safe to re-run in existing projects

### Added

- File existence checks for all generated files
- Automatic .bak backup creation when requested
- User confirmation prompts
